As a huge Adventure Time fan I want to create an interactive and fun character library that truly embodies the Cartoon Network spirit. 
I will be designing it to find the sweet spot between crime documentary and a video game. 
This website will contain:
A Login Page; Pages for each character with their description.
I am currently still working on it, it is definitly in its most fundemental stages.
To login there is no need for a username or password -yet..
